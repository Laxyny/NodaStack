## ‚ú® Features

- **One-Click Services**: Launch Apache, PHP, MySQL, and phpMyAdmin instantly.
- **Docker-Powered**: Leverages the power and isolation of Docker, without the complexity.
- **Project Management**: Easily create, manage, and browse projects in your `www` directory.
- **Modern UI**: A clean and intuitive WPF interface with light and dark modes.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Built-in logging and service status indicators.
- **Lightweight & Portable**: Use the installer or just run the portable version.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The codebase is organized into two main projects:

- **NodaStack.Core** ‚Äì Contains domain models shared across the application.
- **NodaStack** ‚Äì The WPF interface referencing the core library.

This separation keeps core logic independent from the user interface and paves the way for additional front‚Äëends or services.
